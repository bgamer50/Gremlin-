Version 0.6.0 (June 11, 2022)

Gremlin++ is the core of a C++ interpreter for the Gremlin language.
It is licensed under the Apache license.  Version 0.6.0 overhauls the
performance of the interpreter and adds additional steps, primarily
to support the BitGraph project.  A 1.0 release is targeted for later
this year.

Gremlin++ is a platform-independent header library.  To use Gremlin++
in your project, simply set it as an include directory.

While the goal of Gremlin++ is to support the same semantics as
standard Gremlin, there are currently a few steps that differ,
particularly the Repeat Step.  Work is currently underway to
improve documentation of these differences.

suffice.
